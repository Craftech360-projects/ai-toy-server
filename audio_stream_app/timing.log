Once upon a time, in a land filled with blocks and toys, there was a little robot named Zeta who loved to demolish things (but only old, broken things that needed to be thrown away). Zeta's favorite job was to help clean up the playground by knocking down old, broken swings and slides, making way for brand new, super cool ones. One sunny day, Zeta got to demolish an old, rickety bridge, and as it came tumbling down, all the kids cheered and thanked Zeta for helping make their playground safer and more fun. After that, Zeta felt like a hero and couldn't wait to help with the next demolition project. The end!

Max, the little dog, loved going on walks with his owner. One day, they found a little puppy who was lost in the park. Max's tail started wagging, and he ran to say hello to the puppy. The puppy was shy, but Max showed him all the fun things to do in the park, like chasing balls and playing in the sandbox. Together, Max and the puppy had so much fun that they became instant friends. Max's owner said, "Let's take the puppy home and find his owner." Max was happy to help, and soon they found the puppy's home. The puppy's owner was so thankful, and Max felt happy that he could help make someone's day a little brighter. From that day on, Max and the puppy would meet in the park every day and have more exciting adventures together!
